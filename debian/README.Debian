This package installs the repl.lua script in the Lua directory. It
installs a shell wrapper around this Lua script so that you can use
the REPL with a multitude of Lua interpreters.

/usr/share/lua/5.1/repl.lua

and

/usr/share/lua/5.2/repl.lua

If you have both Lua 5.1 and Lua 5.1 installed. It can be used with
any of the lua5.1, lua5.2 or luajit REPLs. To invoke the REPL with the
environment configured Lua version do:

lua-repl

for luajit do:

luajit-repl

for lua5.2 do:

lua5.2-repl

for lua5.1 do:

lua5.1-repl

You can develop your own plugins. See the example.lua file in the docs
directory for examples.
